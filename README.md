# WeaponShop

Weapon Shop console app created by Kevin Teran

This project was completed during my third year at George Brown College to
demostrate my knowledge of data Structures

The backpack class is implemented as a linked list. It can hold any number 
of weapons as long as maxWeight is not crossed. 

The shop inventory is implemented as a binary search tree.

To run: Clone repository and run in visual Studio
